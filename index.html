                <p>Hi! my name is DJ Patrias and I am from Las Vegas, NV. I am a big fan of Dragon Ball Z and a very avid gamer. I am excited to learn more about coding! 
                    I am looking forward to see where this journey takes me as i am still a noob at this. Coding is hard but its very fun to learn at the same time! 
                    I hope to use it for video games or possibly something around that industry. I have 2 dogs ones name is Diesel and the other is Kratos the puppy in my picture. 
                     Born and Raised in Las Vegas, NV I Love the Heat! Coding is very tough and challenging but findinh  bugs and fixes is very satisfying.   </p>

                    "Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. 
                    At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated North American city founded within that century 
                    (a similar distinction was earned by Chicago in the 19th century). Population growth has accelerated since the 
                    1960s and into the 21st century, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. 
                    As with most major metropolitan areas, the name of the primary city ("Las Vegas" in this case) is often used to describe 
                    areas beyond official city limits."
